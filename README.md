# OCC-in-Buildings
## An experimental study for energy saving based on occupancy-centric control in buildings.

This study aims to understand how OCC (Occupancy-Centric Control) can save energy and improve comfort in real buildings. We conducted a thorough experiment using data from an actual office building. We collected information about when people were in different parts of the building and used this data to adjust the building's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. We tested different time intervals—every 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes—to see how they affected energy efficiency and comfort.

We've provided two folders for you to explore. 
# Experimental Data
It contains raw data we collected during the experiment for occupancy information for various zones of the office building. 
# Results
This contains detailed results from simulations using OpenStudio and EnergyPlus. These results show how applying OCC impacted each zone's energy usage and comfort levels.
